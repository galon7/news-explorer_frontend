# Final project - ![NewsExplorer](./src/images/newsExplorer.png) News explorer frontend

## [This is a website](https://gnews.students.nomoreparties.sbs/) for finding news stories and storing them.

In this project I used React on the frontend, to interact with [News API](https://newsapi.org/) and [the API I built in the last project](https://github.com/galon7/news-explorer-api) for storing users and articles.
